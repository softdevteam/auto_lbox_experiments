# Automatic Language Boxes Experiment

Benchmark automatic language boxes in Eco.

## Requirements

- Python2
- (Optional) PyPy
- (Optional) PyQt4

## Quickstart

To run the experiment simply execute `build.sh`. This will run all benchmarks
and should take approximately 3-4 hours on a reasonably fast machine if PyPy is
installed. It will then analyse the results and generate latex tables which can
be found in `latex/`.
